To commit to annual spending, contact Pinecone.
ℹ️NoteThis workflow creates a new Pinecone organization. If you already have an organization, signing up through AWS Marketplace creates an additional organization.
To configure Pinecone billing through the AWS Marketplace, follow these steps:

Log in to the AWS Marketplace. Your project must be enabled for purchase by your billing administrator.
Search for the Pinecone listing.
Click Subscribe.
Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
Click Subscribe.
Click the Set up your account button.
Sign in to Pinecone.io.

When you sign in, Pinecone creates a new organization linked to your AWS billing.
If you already have a Pinecone organization, you can select the new "AWS Linked" organization in the top-left drop-down menu in the console.Updated 19 days ago
