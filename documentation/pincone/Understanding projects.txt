This document explains the concepts related to Pinecone projects.
Projects contain indexes and users
Each Pinecone project contains a number of indexes and users. Only a user who belongs to the project can access the indexes in that project. Each project also has at least one project owner. All of the pods in a single project are located in a single environment. 
Project settings
When you create a new project, you can choose the name, deployment environment, and pod limit.
Project environment
When creating a project, you must choose a cloud environment for the indexes in that project. The following table lists the available cloud regions, the corresponding values of the environment parameter for the init() operation, and which billing tier has access to each environment:

* This environment has unique features and limitations. See gcp-starter environment for more information.
 Contact us if you need a dedicated deployment in other regions.
The environment cannot be changed after the project is created.
Project pod limit
You can set the maximum number of pods that can be used in total across all indexes in a project. Use this to control costs.
The pod limit can be changed only by the project owner.
Project roles
There are two project roles: Project owner and project member. Table 1 below summarizes the permissions for each role.

API keys
Each Pinecone project has one or more API keys. In order to make calls to the Pinecone API, a user must provide a valid API key for the relevant Pinecone project.
To view the API key for your project, open the Pinecone console, select the project, and click API Keys.Updated 6 days ago Table of Contents
