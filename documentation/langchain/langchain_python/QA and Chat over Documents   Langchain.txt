Unstructured data can be loaded from many sources.Use the LangChain integration hub to browse the full set of loaders.Each loader returns data as a LangChain Document.Documents are turned into a Chat or QA app following the general steps below:Splitting: Text splitters break Documents into splits of specified size Storage: Storage (e.g., often a vectorstore) will house and often embed the splitsRetrieval: The app retrieves splits from storage (e.g., often with similar embeddings to the input question) Output: An LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved splits Quickstart​The above pipeline can be wrapped with a VectorstoreIndexCreator.In particular: Specify a Document loaderThe splitting, storage, retrieval, and output generation stages are wrappedLet's load this blog post on agents as an example Document.We have a QA app in a few lines of code.Set environment variables and get packages:pip install openaipip install chromadbexport OPENAI_API_KEY="..."Run:from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator# Document loaderloader = WebBaseLoader("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/")# Index that wraps above stepsindex = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])# Question-answeringquestion = "What is Task Decomposition?"index.query(question)' Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done using LLM with simple prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) is an example of a task decomposition technique that explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure.'Of course, some users do not want this level of abstraction.Below, we will discuss each stage in more detail.1. Loading, Splitting, Storage​1.1 Getting started​Specify a Document loader.# Document loaderfrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderloader = WebBaseLoader("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/")data = loader.load()Split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage.# Splitfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplittertext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 500, chunk_overlap = 0)all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)Embed and store the splits in a vector database (Chroma).# Store from langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits,embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())Here are the three pieces together:1.2 Going Deeper​1.2.1 Integrations​Document LoadersBrowse the > 120 data loader integrations here.See further documentation on loaders here.Document TransformersAll can ingest loaded Documents and process them (e.g., split).See further documentation on transformers here.VectorstoresBrowse the > 35 vectorstores integrations here.See further documentation on vectorstores here. 1.2.2 Retaining metadata​Context-aware splitters keep the location ("context") of each split in the original Document:Markdown filesCode (py or js)Documents2. Retrieval​2.1 Getting started​Retrieve relevant splits for any question using similarity_search.question = "What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question)len(docs)42.2 Going Deeper​2.2.1 Retrieval​Vectorstores are commonly used for retrieval.But, they are not the only option.For example, SVMs (see thread here) can also be used.LangChain has many retrievers including, but not limited to, vectorstores.All retrievers implement some common methods, such as get_relevant_documents().from langchain.retrievers import SVMRetrieversvm_retriever = SVMRetriever.from_documents(all_splits,OpenAIEmbeddings())docs_svm=svm_retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)len(docs)42.2.2 Advanced retrieval​Improve on similarity_search:MultiQueryRetriever generates variants of the input question to improve retrieval.Max marginal relevance selects for relevance and diversity among the retrieved documents.Documents can be filtered during retrieval using metadata filters.# MultiQueryRetrieverimport loggingfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetrieverlogging.basicConfig()logging.getLogger('langchain.retrievers.multi_query').setLevel(logging.INFO)retriever_from_llm = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),                                                  llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0))unique_docs = retriever_from_llm.get_relevant_documents(query=question)len(unique_docs)INFO:langchain.retrievers.multi_query:Generated queries: ['1. How can Task Decomposition be approached?', '2. What are the different methods for Task Decomposition?', '3. What are the various approaches to decomposing tasks?']53. QA​3.1 Getting started​Distill the retrieved documents into an answer using an LLM (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) with RetrievalQA chain.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAqa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm,retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())qa_chain({"query": question}){'query': 'What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?', 'result': 'The approaches to task decomposition include:\n\n1. Simple prompting: This approach involves using simple prompts or questions to guide the agent in breaking down a task into smaller subgoals. For example, the agent can be prompted with "Steps for XYZ" and asked to list the subgoals for achieving XYZ.\n\n2. Task-specific instructions: In this approach, task-specific instructions are provided to the agent to guide the decomposition process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to "Write a story outline" as a subgoal.\n\n3. Human inputs: This approach involves incorporating human inputs in the task decomposition process. Humans can provide guidance, feedback, and suggestions to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\n\nThese approaches aim to enable efficient handling of complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.'}3.2 Going Deeper​3.2.1 Integrations​LLMsBrowse the > 55 LLM integrations here.See further documentation on LLMs here. 3.2.2 Running LLMs locally​The popularity of PrivateGPT and GPT4All underscore the importance of running LLMs locally.LangChain has integrations with many open source LLMs that can be run locally.Using GPT4All is as simple as downloading the binary and then:from langchain.llms import GPT4Allfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQAllm = GPT4All(model="/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin",max_tokens=2048)qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm,retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())qa_chain({"query": question}){'query': 'What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?', 'result': ' There are three main approaches to task decomposition: (1) using language models like GPT-3 for simple prompting such as "Steps for XYZ.\\n1.", (2) using task-specific instructions, and (3) with human inputs.'}3.2.2 Customizing the prompt​The prompt in RetrievalQA chain can be easily customized.# Build promptfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplatetemplate = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer as concise as possible.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:', 'language': 'en'})3.2.4 Citations​Answer citations can be returned using RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChainqa_chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(llm,retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())result = qa_chain({"question": question})result{'question': 'What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?', 'answer': 'The approaches to Task Decomposition include (1) using LLM with simple prompting, (2) using task-specific instructions, and (3) incorporating human inputs.\n', 'sources': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}3.2.5 Customizing retrieved docs in the LLM prompt​Retrieved documents can be fed to an LLM for answer distillation in a few different ways.stuff, refine, map-reduce, and map-rerank chains for passing documents to an LLM prompt are well summarized here.stuff is commonly used because it simply "stuffs" all retrieved documents into the prompt.The load_qa_chain is an easy way to pass documents to an LLM using these various approaches (e.g., see chain_type).from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chainchain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type="stuff")chain({"input_documents": unique_docs, "question": question},return_only_outputs=True){'output_text': 'The approaches to task decomposition include (1) using simple prompting to break down tasks into subgoals, (2) providing task-specific instructions to guide the decomposition process, and (3) incorporating human inputs for task decomposition.'}We can also pass the chain_type to RetrievalQA.qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm,retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),                                       chain_type="stuff")result = qa_chain({"query": question})In summary, the user can choose the desired level of abstraction for QA:4. Chat​4.1 Getting started​To keep chat history, first specify a Memory buffer to track the conversation inputs / outputs.from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemorymemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)The ConversationalRetrievalChain uses chat in the Memory buffer. from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChainretriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()chat = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm,retriever=retriever,memory=memory)result = chat({"question": "What are some of the main ideas in self-reflection?"})result['answer']"Some of the main ideas in self-reflection include:\n1. Iterative improvement: Self-reflection allows autonomous agents to improve by refining past action decisions and correcting mistakes.\n2. Trial and error: Self-reflection is crucial in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\n3. Two-shot examples: Self-reflection is created by showing pairs of failed trajectories and ideal reflections for guiding future changes in the plan.\n4. Working memory: Reflections are added to the agent's working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying.\n5. Performance evaluation: Self-reflection involves continuously reviewing and analyzing actions, self-criticizing behavior, and reflecting on past decisions and strategies to refine approaches.\n6. Efficiency: Self-reflection encourages being smart and efficient, aiming to complete tasks in the least number of steps."The Memory buffer has context to resolve "it" ("self-reflection") in the below question.result = chat({"question": "How does the Reflexion paper handle it?"})result['answer']"The Reflexion paper handles self-reflection by showing two-shot examples to the Learning Language Model (LLM). Each example consists of a failed trajectory and an ideal reflection that guides future changes in the agent's plan. These reflections are then added to the agent's working memory, up to a maximum of three, to be used as context for querying the LLM. This allows the agent to iteratively improve its reasoning skills by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes."4.2 Going deeper​The documentation on ConversationalRetrievalChain offers a few extensions, such as streaming and source documents.Previousimage_agentNextContext aware text splitting and QA / ChatQuickstart1.
