You should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same tokenizer as used in the language model. tiktoken‚Äãtiktoken is a fast BPE tokenizer created by OpenAI.We can use it to estimate tokens used. It will probably be more accurate for the OpenAI models.How the text is split: by character passed inHow the chunk size is measured: by tiktoken tokenizer#!pip install tiktoken# This is a long document we can split up.with open("../../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:    state_of_the_union = f.read()from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplittertext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(    chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0)texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)print(texts[0])    Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman.

Six days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.        But he badly miscalculated.                 He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.        Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.                 He met the Ukrainian people.                 From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.SentenceTransformers‚ÄãThe SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter is a specialized text splitter for use with the sentence-transformer models. The default behaviour is to split the text into chunks that fit the token window of the sentence transformer model that you would like to use.from langchain.text_splitter import SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplittersplitter = SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter(chunk_overlap=0)text = "Lorem "count_start_and_stop_tokens = 2text_token_count = splitter.count_tokens(text=text) - count_start_and_stop_tokensprint(text_token_count)    2token_multiplier = splitter.maximum_tokens_per_chunk // text_token_count + 1# `text_to_split` does not fit in a single chunktext_to_split = text * token_multiplierprint(f"tokens in text to split: {splitter.count_tokens(text=text_to_split)}")    tokens in text to split: 514text_chunks = splitter.split_text(text=text_to_split)print(text_chunks[1])    loremNLTK‚ÄãThe Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language.Rather than just splitting on "\n\n", we can use NLTK to split based on NLTK tokenizers.How the text is split: by NLTK tokenizer.How the chunk size is measured:by number of characters# pip install nltk# This is a long document we can split up.with open("../../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:    state_of_the_union = f.read()from langchain.text_splitter import NLTKTextSplittertext_splitter = NLTKTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)print(texts[0])    Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman.
