We can also set an early stopping method, which will determine our agent's behavior once the number of max iterations is hit. By default, the early stopping uses method force which just returns that constant string. Alternatively, you could specify method generate which then does one FINAL pass through the LLM to generate an output.mrkl = initialize_agent(    tools,    llm,    agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,    verbose=True,    max_iterations=2,    early_stopping_method="generate",)mrkl.run("What is the weather in NYC today, yesterday, and the day before?")
