By default, this is set to "AI", but you can set this to be anything you want. Note that if you change this, you should also change the prompt used in the chain to reflect this naming change. Let's walk through an example of that in the example below.# Here it is by default set to "AI"conversation = ConversationChain(    llm=llm, verbose=True, memory=ConversationBufferMemory())conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")            > Entering new ConversationChain chain...    Prompt after formatting:    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.        Current conversation:        Human: Hi there!    AI:        > Finished ConversationChain chain.    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"conversation.predict(input="What's the weather?")            > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

How can I help you today?    Human: What's the weather?    AI:        > Finished ConversationChain chain.    ' The current weather is sunny and warm with a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
