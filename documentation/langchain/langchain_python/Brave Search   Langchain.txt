As of May 2022, it covered over 10 billion pages and was used to serve 92%
of search results without relying on any third-parties, with the remainder being retrieved
server-side from the Bing API or (on an opt-in basis) client-side from Google. According
to Brave, the index was kept "intentionally smaller than that of Google or Bing" in order to
help avoid spam and other low-quality content, with the disadvantage that "Brave Search is
not yet as good as Google in recovering long-tail queries."Brave Search Premium: As of April 2023 Brave Search is an ad-free website, but it will
eventually switch to a new model that will include ads and premium users will get an ad-free experience.
User data including IP addresses won't be collected from its users by default. A premium account
will be required for opt-in data-collection.Installation and Setup‚ÄãTo get access to the Brave Search API, you need to create an account and get an API key.api_key = "..."from langchain.document_loaders import BraveSearchLoaderExample‚Äãloader = BraveSearchLoader(    query="obama middle name", api_key=api_key, search_kwargs={"count": 3})docs = loader.load()len(docs)    3[doc.metadata for doc in docs]    [{'title': "Obama's Middle Name -- My Last Name -- is 'Hussein.'
